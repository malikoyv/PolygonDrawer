# Google Maps Polygons Visualization
This project demonstrates how to use the Google Maps API to visualize polygons based on provided coordinates and calculate their enclosed area using Python.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Google Maps JavaScript API Key

## Installation

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-maps-polygons.git
   cd google-maps-polygons
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the script, replace `API_KEY` in `google_maps_polygons.py` with your own Google Maps JavaScript API Key. You can obtain an API Key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

## Usage

Run the script `google_maps_polygons.py` to generate an HTML file that visualizes the polygons on a Google Map.

```bash
python google_maps_polygons.py
```

This will generate an HTML file named `google_maps_polygons.html` in the current directory.

## Features

- **create_polygon(coordinates)**: Generates a Google Maps Polygon object based on provided coordinates.
- **calculate_polygon_area(coordinates)**: Computes the area of a polygon using the shoelace formula.
- **generate_html(polygons)**: Generates an HTML file containing a Google Map with visualized polygons.

## Example

Here's an example of how the script generates the HTML file:

1. Defines polygon coordinates for Gda≈Ñsk, Poland.
2. Calculates the area of the polygon.
3. Generates an HTML file (`google_maps_polygons.html`) with the polygon visualized on a Google Map.
